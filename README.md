# pyTainer
pyTainer is a python based container framework, that lets you manage predefined or custom programs. You can easily run/stop/restart/install/... all your containers via an intuitive web panel.

## Documentation
A complete guide is available here: https://github.com/mokny/pytainer/wiki

## Requirements
- Python 3.9.x

## Best use
Basically you can use one pyTainer to maintain all your programs. But as you can run multiple instances of pyTainer (on different ports), it might be a good idea to run one pyTainer for one project. For example: A pyhton server, a log manager, a notification service and a backup service runs on pyTainer A. Your smart home programs run on pyTainer B.
